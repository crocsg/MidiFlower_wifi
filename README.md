# MidiFlower
BLE Midi music generation from BioSensor data

This software was created for an hackathon with [Climate Change Lab](https://climatechangelab.org/) and [La Fabrique Janze](https://lafabrique.rafcom.bzh/)
The purpose of the hackathon was the creation of small artistic installation based on music génération from bio data sensor
We used the sensor made by [Sam Cusumano](https://github.com/electricityforprogress/MIDIsprout)

If you want to build the sensor with an ESP32 board, the [documentation is available here](https://wikifab.org/wiki/Capteur_BioData_pour_ESP32)
